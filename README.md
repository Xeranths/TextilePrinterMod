# TextilePrinterMod
A Rimworld mod who allow you to print textiles, leathers and more. Also come with another non buildable ressources generator.

Considering it's my first mod, it was more a "crash test" than anything, so
this mod will highly probably be integrated into another one bigger, keep it in mind !

Add a new high tech workbench with crafts for all textiles/leathers from vanilla, using organics for leathers (anything + a bit of meat),
wood/organic for cloth/devilstrand and neutroamine and plasteel for synthread/hyperweave.
